Neural View Synthesis and Appearance Editing from Unstructured Images,Indian Conference on Computer Vision Graphics and Image Processing (ICVGIP) 2021 ,We present a neural rendering framework for simultaneous view synthesis and appearance editing of a scene with known environmental illumination captured using a mobile camera. Our approach explicitly disentangles the appearance and learns a lighting representation that is independent of it. We show results of editing the appearance of real scenes in interesting and non-trivial ways.,/assets/img/pub/app.png,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3490035.3490299,/appearance-editing/,https://github.com/darthgera123/Appearance-Editing,https://youtu.be/ZCVQj5FK0C4,"Pulkit Gera, Aakash.KT, Dhawal Sirikonda, P.J Narayanan"
