  We present a neural rendering framework for simultaneous view synthesis and appearance editing of a scene with known environmental illumination captured using a mobile camera. Our approach explicitly disentangles the appearance and learns a lighting representation that is independent of it. We show results of editing the appearance of real scenes in interesting and non-trivial ways.
