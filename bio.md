Hi, I am Pulkit Gera. I like to explore the unknown. 

## Professional
I am working in the field of Computer Vision/Graphics at Center for Vision Information (CVIT), IIIT Hyderabad. My research advisior is [Prof P.J Narayanan](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~pjn/). I am pursuing Dual Degree (B.Tech + MS by Research) at IIIT Hyderabad. Previously I have interned at multiple AI startups and currently I am an intern under [Prof Jean-Francois Lalonde](http://vision.gel.ulaval.ca/~jflalonde/).

## Personal 
I like to follow multiple sports. I am a huge Manchester United fan and that Rooney Bicycle is forever etched in my memory. I also love cricket and Yuvi's six sixes got me hooked onto it. Besides that I love reading blogs and novels. I enjoy watching TV shows, movies and anime and to critique them. Attack on Titan and Breaking Bad are my answers to the question : "What is Peak fiction?"
