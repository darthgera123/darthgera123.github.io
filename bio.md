Hi, I am Pulkit Gera. I like to explore the unknown.  
I am a Ph.D. student at MPI-INF, Saarbrücken. I am working at [4D and Quantum Vision](https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) group under the tutelage of [Prof. Vladislav Golyanik](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~golyanik/) and [Prof. Christian Theobalt](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~theobalt/). I am working in Neural Rendering and Scene Reconstruction. 


## Professional
I pursued B.Tech+MS in the field of Computer Vision and Graphics at CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad under [Prof P.J Narayanan](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~pjn/) and [Prof. Jean-François Lalonde](http://vision.gel.ulaval.ca/~jflalonde/). My thesis titled "Casual Scene Capture and Editing" can be found here. I pursued an independent study with [Prof Vasudeva Verma](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=9OFvbfcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr Balaji Vasan Srinivasan](https://research.adobe.com/person/balaji-vasan-srinivasan/) on transformer based approach to multi-modal news summarization. In addition I was lucky to have worked with [Aakash K.T](https://aakashkt.github.io/), [Dhawal Sirikonda](https://dhawal1939.github.io/) and [Mohammed Reza Karimi](https://github.com/MrKarimiD).

## Personal 
I love watching sports. I follow football because of [Wayne Rooney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km_9ntw05pw), cricket because of [Yuvraj Singh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b0ubLO2MUE), tennis because of [Rafael Nadal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkwVuqNxq-o) and F1 because of [Sebastian Vettel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZtPoOhZAw8).

I love travelling. [Kudle Beach, Gokarna](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g651646-d3461829-Reviews-Kudle_Beach-Gokarna_Uttara_Kannada_District_Karnataka.html) and [Baratang Island, Andamans](https://traveltriangle.com/blog/baratang-island/) are some of the most ethereal places I have been to. You can win my heart by bringing me [Hyderabadi Dum Biryani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4-LHeIx15U). I enjoy watching TV Series and Anime. [The Office(US)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRox23WtU_4) and [Nichijou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcQFBdLNvZU) are my recommendations for comedy shows. [Breaking Bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHKrCs1rFRI) and [Attack on Titan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrvjD88nzFA) in my unbiased opinion are the greatest fictional shows of all time.
