Mip-NeRF,Generate high resolution novel views of a scene which is encoded by Neural Radiance Fields. Pytorch port of the paper ,https://github.com/darthgera123/mip_nerf_pytorch,,CV
Multimodal Summarization of News Articles,Generate high quality summarizations of news articles by levraging text and image modalities. We use visio-linguistic transformers like OSCAR to minimize the distance between modalities and generate high quality summaries.,https://github.com/darthgera123/Multimodal-Summarization,,NLP
Deferred Neural Rendering,"Given a set of images of an object and its corresponding UV maps, we aim to perform novel view synthesis. With the help of Neural Textures and a corresponding Neural Renderer we can produce novel views.",,,CV
Mirror GAN,"Given a textual description, we aim to generate images. The method uses a cyclic loss where we take the loss on the ground truth text and text generated on the generated image. Tested with a novel Stanford Dogs with Captions dataset.",https://github.com/darthgera123/Mirror-GAN,,CV
Cycle GAN,"Given an image, we wish to generate its painting version. The method uses a cyclic loss where we take the loss on ground truth and the image generated back from the generated image. Trained with a corpus of variety of paintings.",https://github.com/darthgera123/GANtastic,,CV
